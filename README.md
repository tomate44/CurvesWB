# FreeCAD Curves Workbench

<!--## Compatibility (important)
:exclamation: **Don't use this repo if you care about py2-support and support of freecad < 0.18. If so please have a look at the traditional workbench structure.**

## Motivation and usage
This is a template for a FreeCAD workbench / module. As python-packaging and packaging for FreeCAD is not an easy task, this repository should give a overview of the things learned so far. If all you want is to create an extension for FreeCAD (module, additional gui-stuff, workbench), simple copy this repo and start replacing things.

To try the latest release of this template:
```bash
# Install this template
pip install freecad.workbench_starterkit

# Uninstall (to remove this template)
pip uninstall freecad.workbench_starterkit 
```

**Note:** There are currently two FreeCAD workbench styles. For lack of better names, we use the terms "old style" and "new style" (See [Glossary terms used in this discussion](#glossary-terms-used-in-this-discussion-that-may-lead-to-confusion)). For more discussion about the motivation behind the "new style" see [Motivation for New Style Modules](#motivation-for-new-style-modules).

## Structure of a workbench:

### Initialization Files

- `init_gui.py`: mandatory for modules adding new functionality to the GUI.
- `__init__.py`: entry function for non-gui FreeCAD and python. Called when you import your package: `from freecad import my_package`

Both of these initialization files are called when the FreeCAD-gui is launched. Launching `freecadcmd` or importing FreeCAD (`import freead`) will call the `__init__.py` file. (*The python import will not yet work on every system, but we are working towards a standardization*).

### Structure
This is the minimal structure of a namespace-package to add a workbench to FreeCAD.

```
freecad/
└── workbench_starterkit/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── init_gui.py
```

**Note:** `init_gui.py` are called at startup of FreeCAD.  
:exclamation: **Do not put very time-intensive code in these files to reduce the start-up time.**


## Naming of FreeCAD modules

Several names are needed:
- **repository-name**  
  The name of the repository AKA `freecad.repository_name`  
  eg.: `freecad.workbench_starterkit`

- **distribution-name**  
  This name is set in the [setup.py](setup.py)  
  eg.: `name='freecad.workbench_starterkit'`

- **package-name**  
  The name of the package which can be imported from python.  
  **Notes:** it's possible that there are several packages in one repository with only one `setup.py`. You **simply specify all packages and modules** in the `packages` section of the `setup.py`.  
  This name **must not contain** any python operator symbols like "-".  
  If the repository contains only one pthon-package it makes sense to choose the same names for the repository-name, python-package and the pypi-package.  
  eg.: `freecad.workbench_starterkit`


## Rules

**The "freecad" namespace is not allowed to be used directly.**  
This means it is not allowed to set any variables in the `__init__.py` of freecad. (But as with python3 this `__init__.py` should not exist anyway, this isn't a problem.) Further it's not allowed to add variables to the freecad-namespace directly. This can introduce name-clashes.  

Examples:  
:x: `freecad.myVariable = 10`  
:+1: `freecad.app.myVariable = 10`


## Testing your module/workbench

If you want to work on your extension you have the following options:

- Start FreeCAD from the root-directory you are working in (eg. workbench_starterkit)
- Simply link the extension to a location where python can find it.
- `pip install -e .` adds the root-directory to easy_install.path.

## Using pip (setuptool or distutlis)

Currently FreeCAD has several ways to install packages: 
1. [Freecad Addon Manager][AddonManager] 
2. [freecad-pluginloader][pluginloader]  

With `pip` and `pypi` a third option is introduced. In addition, utilizing `pip` also provides powerful possibilities to install third party dependencies.

### setup file

The `setup.py` file located in the main directory is a minimal example to get an extension installed. There we are using `setuptools`. If you need advanced options to install your package, please have a look at the [setuptools docs][setuptools].

### versions

It's common practice to include a version-string in the python-package. The version should then be imported to the root-`__init__.py` to use it like this:

```python
import freecad.workbench_starterkit
freecad.workbench_starterkit.__version__
```

In the setup.py we do not have access to the library itself, so the `__version__` must be imported without the assumption that the package is installed. This can be done by running the file directly with `exec`.  

:exclamation:**TODO**: Is there any better way to do this?

### resources

In addition to the `setup.py` there is often the need for a [`MANIFEST.in`][MANIFEST] With this file it's possible to install data like icons, documentation files, ... (everything not directly connected to python).  
To tell `setuptools` to use the `MANIFEST.in` add this line to the setup function in the setup.py:

```python
setup(..., include_package_data=True)
```

### dependencies

you can specify required packages by setting the `install_requires` in the setup-function of the `setup.py`

```python
setup(..., install_requires=['required_package'], ...)
```

### install local

To install your extension locally with pip, do the following from a cmd (windows) or terminal (unix):

```bash
cd <path_to_your_package>
pip install .
```

### uploading your package to pypi

Please have a look at this [pypi twine tutorial][twine].

Be careful with version-numbering. It seems pypi doesn't allow to upload a package with a version smaller then the biggest version of the package uploaded. This seems to be true also for deleted packages and deleted versions.

Once uploaded, the package can be installed with:

```bash
pip install <package-name>
```

## Additional Information

### Projects using this structure

- [pyrate][pyrate] - Optical raytracing based on Python

### Glossary

- **_module_** : a Python source file, which can expose classes, functions and global variables
- **_package_** : a directory containing Python modules.
- **_distribution_** : the artifacts which are created by running the setup.py. Can contain multiple packages.
- **_workbench_** : a _graphical space_ inside the FreeCAD-Gui which adds functionality related to a specific task
- **_namespace-package_** : a package which adds functionality to a specific namespace. For FreeCAD we are talking about packages which are importable with `from freecad import my_package`. (Sometimes it's also called new-style-module)
- **_extension-module_**: a library (`.so` or `.dll`) written in C/C++ which adds the possibility to import this library with python.

### Glossary terms used in this discussion (that may lead to confusion)

- **_freecad-module_**: It's anything available through FreeCAD's python interpreter and placed in FreeCADs directory structure.  
This can be a **module, package, workbench, namespace-package, extension-module**.
- **_new_style_module_**: This refers to **packages** which are added to FreeCAD as **namespace-packages**
- **_old_style_module_**: A **package** which is plugged into FreeCAD by adding it's base-directory to `sys.path` and uses `Init.py` and `InitGui.py` to get initialized by FreeCAD.

### Motivation for New Style Modules
There are several reasons why you might consider using the "new style" modules proposed in this template, and upgrade existing workbenches using the "old style".

1. The ability to execute your module using a regular `python` interpreter and have it "just work" (See [related forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=40749#p346331)).

2. Name-spaced packages avoid namespace collisions and the need to have a common prefix on all classes and files to ensure uniqueness (See [related forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=38593&p=345439#p345437)).

3. Integrating with [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) / [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). The ability to `pip install freecad.myworkbench` (See [related forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=38476&p=326444#p326574)).

4. InitGui.py and Init.py ("old-style") do not behave like expected because these files are called with exec and are not properly imported. This leads to problems like:
   - `__file__` not useable to get the path to the python file
   - predefined variables

### Tip

Due to the fact we are now using the `pktutil-module` to find extensions of FreeCAD, it's possible to use standard-python-paths to place the extension. This is any location which is included in the `sys.path`.  

To get a list of all the locations simple run this code in the FreeCAD-console:

```python
import sys
sys.path
```
